### The task(s)

The Bureau of Adversarial Dossiers and Securely Encrypted Code (BADSEC) has asked you to retrieve a list of VIP users.

Fortunately, BADSEC provides an API to the agency you've been working with. Unfortunately, it's not the best API in the world.

Your job is to write a program that securely and politely asks the BADSEC server for this list of users and prints it to stdout in JSON format.
